"""kt-biome consumer end-to-end test for Cluster 1 / A.5.

Verifies that the refactor of ``kt-biome/creatures/swe/prompts/system.md``
to use ``{% include "git-safety" %}`` renders correctly, and that the
git-safety prose previously inlined in the creature's system prompt
still appears in the rendered output once the kt-biome package's
``prompts:`` manifest slot is consulted.

This is the "at least one kt-biome consumer end-to-end" bar from
the extension-point decisions §7.3.
